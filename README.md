# AIGen
AIGen is an artificial intelligence software for complex genetic data analysis. This software based on two newly developed neural networks (i.e., kernel neural networks and functional neural networks) that are capable of modeling complex genotype-phenotype relationships (e.g., interactions) while providing robust performance against high-dimensional genetic data. Moreover, computationally efficient algorithms (e.g., a minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation approach and batch training) are implemented in the package to accelerate the computation, making them computationally efficient for analyzing large-scale datasets with thousands or even millions of samples.
